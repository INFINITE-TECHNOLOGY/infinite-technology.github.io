### BlackBox

BlackBox is a logging code automation solution.

BlackBox Annotation automatically injects a lot of logging code into user-defined Groovy methods/constructors without affecting the user program logic.

Granularity of injected code can be defined by the user (programmer) up to:

* Method Exception handling transformation, Method Exceptions logging (exception and causing method arguments are logged)
* Method transformation, Method invocation logging (method arguments and result are logged)
* Statement transformation, Statement-level logging
* Expression transformation, Expression-level logging

# Infinite Technology âˆž Bobbin

## Purpose

This blueprint defines the solution to process input logging data and store it in a structured way by the means of 
implementing an Slf4j-compatible logging library written in Groovy language.

## In short

Bobbin creates isolated log files per thread with simple configuration using Groovy Scripts to compute dynamic parameter 
values during run-time.

## Introduction

### Foreword

Possibly due to a certain lack of theoretical provision, Logging has always been an zone of turbulence in the Java world.
This caused a diversity of logging libraries to appear over the time, such as:
- Log4j
- Java Util Logging
- Commons Logging
- Logback
- Log4j2

Aiming to address the limitations of others, each one of them unfortunately has been bringing its own shortcomings.

While from the code standardization perspective things got improved with the adaptation of Slf4j as a logging 
abstraction layer, there are still unresolved issues in the existing logging frameworks.

As an Open Source Community, we are taking an initiative to come up with a new experimental approach to create a 
lightweight yet functionally saturated Logger using up-to-date technology such as JSR 223 and Groovy.

### The Problems

> Existing logging solutions provide only partial support for scripting in configuration.

We end up doing declarative programming in logger configuration (XML, JSON, YAML, programmatic configuration) rather 
than configuring logger dynamically interpret configuration values during run-time using imperative scripting.

Let's consider the example of Logback filter configuration to log only INFO messages:
```xml
<filter class="ch.qos.logback.classic.filter.LevelFilter">
  <level>INFO</level>
  <onMatch>ACCEPT</onMatch>
  <onMismatch>DENY</onMismatch>
</filter>
```

This is a typical example of declarative XML programming.

Note: Logback supports Groovy Script filter - but it is applicable only on specific appender, not on Logger.

And there is no support for Groovy message text formatting (encoder pattern).

> It is impossible to configure log level on the appender level

Let's take examples of Logback and Log4j2.

- Appenders are defined separately from Loggers and Loggers reference the appender using "AppenderRef".
- Only Loggers accept Level and Class Name configuration

Let's say we would like to exclude Debug of class Foo from a specific log file, without affecting other log files and classes.

In Logback this is solved using Groovy Script Filter on Appender, but when we have many appenders - configuration size grows
quickly.

> Log files per log level

> Overriding Root Level

> There is a disconnect between how the log data is produced by the application and how it is being consumed by the Logger

As a historical practice, existing Loggers are defined either in:
- Class static field
- Instance field - causing overhead in initialization and unnecessary isolation

This reduces the scope of each specific logger instance to the context of its owner class or object in terms of consumption of 
log data.

However the application flow is **not driven by the class structure** rather being reflected into a dynamic 
**execution stack**, which is having a guaranteed immutable anchor - the **thread** in which the stack is being executed.

In practice this misconception causes functional limitations for existing loggers such as:
- Complicated configuration of file naming, log separation and archiving
- Depending on log declaration (static or instance):
  - Static logger: shareable by all threads, but lacking easy per-thread configuration 
  - Instance logger: causing overhead in initialization and unnecessary isolation

For example:
- Logback supports maximum 1 "discriminator" in "SiftingAppender"
- SiftingAppender has limitations in support of archiving and rolling policies
- Complicated configuration of "RoutingAppender" in Log4j2

### The Solution

> Bobbin is using the configuration as a placeholder for Groovy scripts that define the run-time operation of the logger.

Here is how the above "filter" example would have looked like when logger is configured to interpret imperative run-time scripts:
```json
{
  "levels": "['info'].contains(level)"
}
```

Each and every aspect of the logger is configurable using Groovy Script:
- Log levels
- Class Names
- Message Formats
- File Names

> By it's nature, Bobbin is thread-isolated.

Effectively Bobbin always has 1 logger instance per thread.

Technically this greatly simplifies the code-base by easing the requirements for thread-safety and performance congestion.

On a functional level this helps to employ much more simple file naming and archiving configurations.

For example, there is no more need to use MDC for separating log files per thread - the "threadName" token is readily 
available in file name configuration.  

## Key Features

### Integration

Bobbin fully supports Slf4j integration mechanism and can be used in any project with Slf4j - just by adding Bobbin 
dependency during compilation.

Furthermore, Bobbin can be used both in Java and Groovy projects.

### Configuration

#### Events

In Object-oriented terms, existing logging frameworks consider log messages as events belonging to the same hierarchy:
- Trace
- Debug extends Trace
- Info extends Debug
- Warning extends Info
- Error extends Warning

This happens due to *comparable* nature of conventional Log Levels: e.g. Trace < Debug < Info < Warning < Error.

This is a traditional paradigm which is so old that people just take it is as something granted and immutable.

We change this paradigm.

> Bobbin considers log messages as separate *independent events* with different types (as per their level).

With Bobbin it is possible to configure enabled logger levels in a granular way without filter, using array:

```json
{
  "levels": "['info'].contains(level)"
}
```

#### Classes

A conventional thinking: a logger is assigned to one and only one class name or package name.

The Bobbin thinking: a logger can have multiple classes and package names attached to it.

```json
{
  "classes": "className.contains('io.infinite.') || className.endsWith('.HttpSender')"
}
```

#### Scripting

All parameters of Bobbin configuration are interpreted as Groovy scripts:
- Log Levels
- Class Names
- File Names
- Message format

Here is an example of message format configuration:

```json
{
  "format": "\"${dateTime}|${level}|${threadName}|${className}|${event.message}\""
}
```

### Archiving

Bobbin employs a very simple concept for file archiving:
- for each log message, file name is re-computed based on configuration
- if the file name is changed since the previous message - the previous file is archived

Additionally if Bobbin finds that file with the new file name is already existing - it will automatically archive that 
file to prevent data loss. This is especially useful for house-keeping during multiple restarts of application - old logs
are stored in archives.   

### Thread Isolation

Due to its thread-isolated nature, Bobbin does suffer from thread-safety constraints - such as synchronized IO.
Thus in theory it can achieve more performance under heavy load in multi-threaded environment, comparing to existing loggers.

## Principles

### Code simplicity

Bobbin source code is extremely simple with total 13 classes (including 3 Slf4j binding classes).

Jackson Databind is used to deserialize the Bobbin JSON configuration which directly reflects into runtime logger objects.

Simplicity is one of base principles allowing to by bypass a steep maturation curve associated with existing logging solutions.

We save code lines and efforts thanks to using Groovy language features:
- Dynamic programming
- Memoization
- Profiling using AST annotations

Only 2 destinations are supported for output:
- Console
- File

But it covers ~70% of the use cases.

### Configuration simplicity

One of the main burdens of existing Loggers is excessive verbose configuration.

A configuration to save each log level into separate file exceeds 100 lines in Logback.xml and it grows progressively.

Same configuration takes ~30 lines in Bobbin and it scales effectively.

### Thread safety

Bobbin is intended to be used primarily in multi-threaded Batch applications, thus Thread-safety questions is the foundational
principle of Bobbin design.

### Compatibility

Bobbin should be possible to integrate standalone (or using Slf4j) in any valid Java or Groovy environment:

- Application servers
- Spring context; Spring Boot/Grails
- Core Java

### Performance optimization

As a base principle of Bobbin development - efforts are taken to perform performance testing and profiling in order to optimize Bobbin code from the performance perspective.

## Solution Architecture

<img src="https://i-t.io/Bobbin/documentation/images/Bobbin_Diagram.png" alt="Bobbin Architecture Diagram"/>

- Actual Bobbin loggers are stored in Singleton ThreadLocal - 1 and only 1 per thread
- Logging messages are dispatched to Bobbin loggers via BobbinNameAdapters which can be referenced in instance or static fields
in classes
- BobbinNameAdapter is lightweight class and provides its individual instances via LoggerFactory.getLogger with quick initialization.
- All thread-specific Bobbin loggers share same configuration (Bobbin.json) and can multiple File Destinations
- File Destination holds File Name Mask which is computed for every Log message, therefore resulting in multiple 
log files attached to every File Destination.
